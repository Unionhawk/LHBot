This is a small bot used to administer a mid-sized discord server.  You may fork at your leisure.  Commands can be found via the help command.

Other features: 
- logs some basic server metrics (monthly messages per channel, number of active users per month, total number of users on server @ EOM)
- Any post accruing enough ðŸ“Œ emoji reacts will be pinned in a given channel. (configurable)
- Any post that a user reacts to with the ðŸ”– will be PMed to the user for later use.

To use:
1. Use npm/node to initialize your working folder.
2. Start the bot once to create an empty config.json. it will probably error out after doing so since it won't have an auth token to log in.
2. all config entries must be enclosed in 'single quotes'; fill the following:
    - authtoken - the authorization token discord generated for your bot. This is necessary to log in.
    - prefix - the prefix for your commands.  '.' or '!' are good options.
    - roleStaff - the ID of the staff or mod role for your server.
    - roleComrade - the ID of regular "user" level role for your server.
    (if your server has a relatively flat structure, you could set these to be the same, or even to match the @everyone role - however, the stronger commands are set up to be staff only, so tread with caution)
    - youTubeAPIKey - Only needed if you plan to use the youtube-to-voice streaming functionality from the .yt command (if not you may delete the yt.js file and the code block relating to Discord.Structures.extend('Guild', Guild => { class MusicGuild extends Guild ... } in bot.js.
3. Once these are filled, the bot should boot and log in.  You can now use the .config command to configure the remaining functions
